## Keynote: Drilling the Chicxulub Impact Structure: Study of Large Impact Formation and Effects on Life
- Sean Gulick (University of Texas, Austin)

Only terristial crater with unequivocal peak ring.

There's an impact crater below Cheesapeak Bay. Ecosystems in imapct craters that are unique to them and seem to have gotten kick-started by them.

Trying to use machine learning to classify rocks entrained in the drilled core.

Found that peak ring was made of granite (deep material), meaning that peak rings are formed by a "rock thrown into a pond" scenario: rock under high pressure acts like a fluid and deep material rebounds like liquid. 

The granite was up to 10% porous because of all the shock.

Just the CT scan of the core is several Tbytes.
